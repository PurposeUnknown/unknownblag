## Who?
Me, I guess! I'm Vee:
- 30something trans woman
- budding electronic musician
- works in the crypto industry
- biohacker, ageplayer, [former podcaster](<https://www.youtube.com/@dojimafuturesexchange>), transhumanist
- relative fan of technologies like cryptocurrency, VR and AI
- nonprofit volunteer

## What?
This is my blog / personal website. It's (probably) where I'll post personal musings, longer-form content, possibly helpful guides to weird personal one-off projects of mine, and so on.

## Where?
If I'm not [wandering virtual worlds](<https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_9a126e50-56b0-497e-bea4-ecee3d9cf7c0>), I'm probably somewhere in Northern California. 

## When?
My sense of personal structure sucks, so things will be posted when they're posted. No set schedule (for now).

## Why?
I've told myself for *years* I should have my own personal website, and I've now owned a personal domain for a little while, so now seems like the time. Enjoy watching me fumble through how to build/manage a website.

## The Moniker
I'm in my goddamn 30s and I've never definitively known what I want to do with my life (and frankly, I'm not sure I ever will), so the idea of building a 'purpose' around 'no purpose' seemed kinda funny to me. I'm kicking around the idea of an alt for music-related projects, but having 'no purpose' seems to stick as my main identity, for now.

(And I've been called all sorts of variants as nicknames: Purpose, Porpoise, Purple, you name it)
